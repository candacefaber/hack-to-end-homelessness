## What is Hack to End Homelessness?

Hack to End Homelessness is a series of events being held in the first week of May 2014 on the causes of and solutions to homelessness. On Thursday, May 1, numerous artists are showing works on the theme of homelessness as part of the First Thursdays Art Walk. On Friday, May 2, we’re proud to host the Seattle premiere of the new documentary "@home," along with a discussion with the film's subject, noted homelessness advocate and social media pioneer Mark Horvath. Finally, on Saturday-Sunday, May 3-4,  there's a two-day "hackathon" where participants will build technology solutions that support people who are homeless and the organizations that serve and advocate for them. This page is specifically addressing the weekend hackathon. See the links above for information on the Art Walk exhibit or the film screening.


## Why Hack to End Homelessness?

The seriousness of homelessness is visible on our streets every day. But the problem goes far beyond what we see on the streets: families with children make up fully half of all homeless people in King County. Likewise, the causes of homelessness go beyond what many people think. Lack of affordable housing and the gap between housing costs and income are significant contributors to homelessness, as are domestic violence, divorce, medical issues, chemical dependency, disabilities and catastrophic events. Despite the progress in our state toward ending homelessness and some nationally recognized innovations in our region, there is much work to be done still. But ending homelessness is possible.

We believe that the technology industry can and should be a leading force for good in our city. Hack to End Homelessness furthers this in three ways:
1. by building solutions to the urgent technology needs of the community.
2. by educating the tech community on the realities of homelessness.
3. by forging relationships between the tech community and the homelessness community that will last well beyond the event.


## Who should participate in the hackathon?

While the event is particularly geared towards technology projects, there is a need for far more than just software developers. After coding, our number-one need is for graphic designers. Writers, journalists, photo and video professionals, students, advocates or any concerned citizens will also be able to contribute and are encouraged to attend.


## How does this differ from other hackathons?

Other popular weekend events, like StartupWeekend or AngelHack, are all about developing your own idea. That works well because you're presumably an expert in your own field. But participants in a hackathon for social change are probably not experts in the field. In previous hackathons, that's usually manifested itself in teams building solutions for the wrong problems or solutions that could never be made to work in practice. For this reason, Hack to End Homelessness gives a key role to the people and organizations that work on homelessness every day. Our partner organizations, which include many of the most impactful homeless service and advocacy groups in Seattle, have each contributed project proposals for technical work that is urgently needed by the community. And they'll be on-site throughout the event, working one-on-one with teams to make sure that what is built will actually have an impact beyond the demos on Sunday.


## What specific projects could I work on?

See here for a list of projects [link]. Check back often as we'll be updating the project list right up until the morning of the event.


## Do I need to pick a project before the start of the event?

No, you'll pick projects on the morning of the event after hearing from each of the organizations with project proposals.


## Can I still work on my own idea or do I have to pick one from the list?

By choosing a project on the curated list you can be certain that your work is providing real value to an organization doing great work to end homelessness every day. But if you have ideas outside our list of projects you're welcome to work on them instead.


## What should I expect at the event?

We encourage everyone attending the hackathon to also register for the “@home” film premiere on Friday night. In the documentary you'll hear firsthand from homeless individuals around the country about their past, their current struggles and their hopes for the future. After the screening there will be a discussion with nationally known homelessness advocate Mark Horvath, and Mark Putnam, director of the Committee to End Homelessness in King County.

The hackathon itself will begin Saturday morning with a short introduction followed by project proposal presentations from each of our partner organizations. They'll each give a three-minute pitch on who they are, how they work to end homelessness, and what projects they're asking people to help with at the event. Then we'll break up for a period of mingling and team formation. Use this time to talk to presenters who interested you and get to know other participants with complementary skills. Then we'll reconvene to make sure everyone has found a project and a team. The next 24+ hours will be the meat of the hackathon: working intensely in a small group, with the help from technology mentors and experts in the field, to build a solution for your chosen problem. On Sunday afternoon we'll have each team demo their completed work to the public and press.

A full schedule will be up soon. 


## What happens after the weekend?

The projects are all chosen so that it's possible to have a working and useful solution done by Sunday afternoon. Keep in mind that very few of the organizations involved have any permanent technical staff, so whatever is produced needs to be deployable and maintainable without technical expertise.

We sincerely hope that many participants will be inspired by projects or organizations and will want to form a more ongoing relationship. After the event we'll support any groups who want to continue on their project or become involved in any way with the problem of homelessness.


## What does it cost and how do I register?

The event costs $100 per participant, or $75 with a discount code. However, no one will be turned away for inability to pay. If you are in need of reduced admission please email ethanpg@gmail.com.

Registration will be open by April 1. Check back here shortly for details.
