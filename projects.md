Our partner organizations, which include many of the most impactful homeless service and advocacy groups in Seattle, have each contributed project proposals for technical work that is urgently needed by the community.

The proposal list below is preliminary, and is meant to give a sense of the sort of work that will be done during the Hack to End Homelessness. This list will be updated with more projects and more specific details on each project as we get closer to the event.


- The [**Washington Low Income Housing Alliance**](http://wliha.org/) and [**YWCA's Firesteel**](http://firesteelwa.org/) are interested in building an interactive map that demonstrates the local impacts of the [Housing Trust Fund](http://www.commerce.wa.gov/Programs/housing/TrustFund/Pages/default.aspx), an important source of funding for affordable housing across our state.

- Mark Horvath, creator of [**InvisiblePeople.tv**](http://invisiblepeople.tv) and the subject of the May 2<sup>nd</sup> film screening, wants help building a social network for people who are homeless, with a focus on supporting low-end mobile phones and SMS.

- Both the [**Housing Development Consortium**](http://www.housingconsortium.org/) and [**Columbia Legal Services**](http://columbialegal.org) have a number of ideas for visualizing the economics of housing and poverty and the data on the 30,000 schoolchildren who are homeless in this state, as well as for better outreach and advocacy tools.

- [**Real Change**](http://www.realchangenews.org/) is interested in better mobile communication/advocacy and bookkeeping tools for its newspaper vendors, and is looking for help with internal database and document management systems, as well as visualization of data on the affordable housing gap and related causes of homelessness.

- The [**Committee to End Homelessness in King County**](http://www.cehkc.org/) wants help visualizing changes in the homeless population and housing inventory over time and across localities.
